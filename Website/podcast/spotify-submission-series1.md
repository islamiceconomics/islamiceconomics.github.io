By the Ottoman peak, an estimated one-third of all productive land was waqf property: irrevocable charitable endowments funding free hospitals, universities, soup kitchens, and water infrastructure. The Suleymaniye Complex, Al-Azhar University, and countless others operated for centuries on this principle. Then European colonial powers systematically dismantled it. Tariq and Amira tell the story of the waqf — the Islamic institution of perpetual charity — its remarkable achievements, its colonial destruction, and its potential modern revival.
