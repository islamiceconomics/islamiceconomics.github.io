## SCENE 1 — The Desert Caravan (Opening)

**Prompt:**
A vast desert at golden hour, a long caravan of camels carrying goods moves slowly across sand dunes. Dust particles shimmer in warm sunlight. Slow aerial drone shot pulling backward, revealing the scale of the caravan stretching to the horizon. Cinematic documentary style, warm amber and gold color palette, film grain, 35mm lens feel.

**Voiceover:** *"Long before modern markets, the economy of the Islamic world was born on trade routes that stretched across continents."*

## SCENE 2 — The Marketplace of Medina

**Prompt:**
A bustling ancient Arabian marketplace at midday. Merchants in white robes display spices, textiles, and pottery on wooden stalls under fabric canopies. People exchange goods with gold coins. Slow dolly-in through the market aisle. Warm natural light filtering through cloth awnings. Documentary style, earthy warm tones, soft diffused lighting, shallow depth of field.

**Voiceover:** *"In seventh-century Medina, the Prophet Muhammad established the first regulated Islamic marketplace — free of fraud, hoarding, and exploitation."*

## SCENE 3 — The Gold Dinar

**Prompt:**
Extreme close-up of a gleaming gold dinar coin with Arabic calligraphy being placed on a dark wooden merchant's table. The coin catches warm candlelight and reflects golden light. Camera slowly orbits around the coin. Macro cinematography, rich gold and dark wood tones, dramatic chiaroscuro lighting, cinematic documentary style.

**Voiceover:** *"The gold dinar became the standard of honest exchange — a currency rooted in intrinsic value, not speculation."*

---

## SCENE 4 — The Silk Road

**Prompt:**
A mountain pass at dawn, a merchant caravan with loaded horses and camels traverses a narrow path between towering rocky cliffs. Mist swirls through the valley below. Slow wide establishing shot from a high angle, gentle camera pan right following the caravan. Epic documentary style, cool blue dawn tones transitioning to warm gold, atmospheric haze.

**Voiceover:** *"Islamic merchants carried more than silk and spice along these routes. They carried ideas — contracts, credit systems, and partnerships that became the blueprint for global commerce."*

---

## SCENE 5 — The Scholar's Study

**Prompt:**
An ancient Islamic scholar sits at a wooden desk in a candlelit room, writing with a quill on parchment. Shelves of leather-bound books line the walls. Warm golden candlelight illuminates the scholar's hands and the page. Slow push-in toward the manuscript. Cinematic documentary, Rembrandt lighting, warm amber tones, intimate atmosphere, film grain.

**Voiceover:** *"Scholars like Ibn Khaldun wrote the first treatises on economic theory — supply and demand, labor value, and the dangers of excessive taxation — centuries before Adam Smith."*

---

## SCENE 6 — The Ottoman Grand Bazaar

**Prompt:**
Interior of a grand Ottoman bazaar with vaulted stone ceilings and hanging lanterns casting warm geometric light patterns. Merchants trade fabrics and jewelry. Camera glides slowly forward through the arched corridor. Rich warm tones, golden lantern light, documentary cinematic style, slightly desaturated with warm highlights.

**Voiceover:** *"By the Ottoman era, Islamic economic institutions — waqf endowments, guild systems, and public treasuries — sustained empires and funded public welfare for centuries."*

---

## SCENE 7 — Modern Skyline (Closing)

**Prompt:**
Aerial shot of a modern Islamic financial district at sunset — glass towers reflecting golden sky, a mosque dome visible among the skyscrapers. Camera slowly rises upward revealing the full cityscape where tradition meets modernity. Golden hour light, cinematic documentary, warm tones transitioning to deep blue twilight, sweeping orchestral feel.

**Voiceover:** *"Today, Islamic finance is a $3.7 trillion industry — but its roots run fourteen centuries deep. This is the golden economy."*

## TITLE CARD
