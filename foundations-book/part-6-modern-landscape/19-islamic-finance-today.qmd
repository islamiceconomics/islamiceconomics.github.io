::: {.callout-tip title="Key Concept"}
Islamic finance has emerged as a major global industry exceeding $2 trillion in assets, yet it faces the critical challenge of ensuring that products align with Islamic economic principles in substance, not merely form—requiring ongoing reform to ensure institutions genuinely embody values of equity, risk-sharing, and social responsibility rather than simply mimicking conventional finance with Islamic labels.
