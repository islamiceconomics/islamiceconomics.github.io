# Preface {.unnumbered}

Welcome to *Principles of Islamic Economics*, an open-access textbook designed for undergraduate students, curious professionals, and anyone seeking a structured introduction to economic thought in the Islamic tradition.

## Why This Book?

Economics textbooks typically begin with scarcity and rational self-interest, then build an entire discipline on those foundations. But what if we started from different premises — stewardship rather than ownership, justice rather than efficiency, community welfare rather than individual utility maximization? That is the intellectual project of Islamic economics.

This book presents Islamic economics as a **coherent alternative framework** for understanding how societies organize production, distribution, and exchange. It is not a defense of Islamic finance products or a guide to Sharia-compliant investing. Rather, it asks: *What does an economy look like when its foundational axioms are drawn from the Quran and Sunnah?*

## Who Is This For?

- **Undergraduate students** encountering Islamic economics for the first time
- **Economics students** who want to see how conventional tools (supply and demand, market structure, monetary policy) look through an Islamic lens
- **Professionals in Islamic finance** seeking deeper theoretical grounding
- **Anyone curious** about how Islamic principles address contemporary economic challenges

## How to Use This Book

The book follows a deliberate structure. **Part I** establishes the worldview and methodology. **Parts II–IV** mirror a standard economics curriculum (micro, money & finance, macro) but rebuild each topic from Islamic foundations. **Part V** covers the distinctive social institutions of Islamic economics. **Part VI** examines the contemporary landscape.

Each chapter includes:

- **Key Concepts** highlighted in green callout boxes
- **Quranic Foundations** in gold callout boxes with relevant verses
- **Hadith References** in blue callout boxes
- **Diagrams and figures** illustrating economic relationships
- **Cross-references** to the [formal Theory section](../theory.html) for advanced mathematical treatment

::: {.callout-tip title="Key Concept"}
You don't need any prior background in Islamic studies *or* economics to follow this book. Each concept is built from first principles.
