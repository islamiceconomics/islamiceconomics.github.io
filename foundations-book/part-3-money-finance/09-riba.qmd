title: "Riba — The Prohibition & Its Logic"
subtitle: "Interest, Debt, and Equity in Islam"
abstract: |
  This chapter provides a comprehensive examination of riba (usury/interest), one of the most significant prohibitions in Islamic economics. We explore the types of riba, the economic rationale for its prohibition, the distinction between debt-based and equity-based financing, and the Islamic critique of the modern interest-based banking system.

## What This Chapter Will Cover

- Definition and etymological origins of riba
- Riba al-fadl (excess) and riba al-nasi'ah (time-based interest)
- Quranic and hadith evidence for the prohibition of riba
- Economic rationale: why interest is forbidden in Islamic law
- The problem of debt dynamics and intergenerational injustice
- Comparison between debt and equity financing
- Critique of the modern banking system from an Islamic perspective
- Alternative financing mechanisms that avoid riba
- Contemporary debates about the definition and scope of riba

::: {.callout-tip title="Key Concept"}
Riba is prohibited not merely as a legal restriction but because it creates fundamental economic injustice: debt-based financing transfers risk to the debtor while guaranteeing returns to the creditor regardless of actual outcomes, whereas Islamic economics prefers equity-based arrangements where risk and reward are shared.
